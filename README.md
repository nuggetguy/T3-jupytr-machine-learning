## KNN

KNN is a supervised learning classifier that is non-parametric and relies on proximity to classify or anticipate how a single data point will be grouped.

## Clustering

By dividing the training space into subspaces, the machine learning approach known as clustered linear regression (CLR) increases the accuracy of conventional linear regression.

## Linear regression

In order to facilitate data analysis and modelling workflows, this code imports a number of libraries and modules for data manipulation, machine learning, and visualisation, including as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and pickle, in addition to certain methods from these libraries.

A Guide to Machine Learning: Understanding the Fundamentals and Techniques
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating systems capable of learning from data and making decisions without being explicitly programmed. It has become a crucial part of many modern technologies, from recommendation systems like those used by Netflix and Amazon to advanced driver assistance systems in cars. In this guide, we will explore the fundamentals of machine learning and introduce some key techniques used in the field.

Understanding the Basics
At its core, machine learning involves training a computer to recognize patterns and make predictions based on data. Imagine you want a computer to identify whether an email is spam or not. Instead of programming explicit rules for every possible type of spam, you would provide the computer with many examples of both spam and non-spam emails. The computer then uses these examples to learn the patterns that distinguish spam from non-spam.

Machine learning algorithms generally fall into three main categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is like teaching with a teacher’s help. In this approach, the algorithm is trained on labeled data, meaning that each piece of data comes with a correct answer. For example, if we are training a model to classify emails as spam or not, each email in the training set is labeled as either “spam” or “not spam.”

There are several techniques used in supervised learning, including:

Linear Regression: This technique is used for predicting continuous values. For example, predicting the price of a house based on its features like size and location.
Logistic Regression: Despite its name, logistic regression is used for binary classification tasks, such as determining if an email is spam or not.
Decision Trees: These models use a tree-like structure of decisions and their possible consequences to make predictions. They are easy to understand and interpret.
Support Vector Machines (SVMs): SVMs find the best boundary between classes to make predictions. They are effective in high-dimensional spaces and are versatile with different kernel functions.
Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is like learning without a teacher. In this case, the algorithm is given data without explicit labels and must find patterns or groupings on its own. This type of learning is useful for discovering hidden structures in data.

Common techniques in unsupervised learning include:

Clustering: This technique groups data into clusters based on similarities. For example, clustering can group customers into segments based on purchasing behavior.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA reduces the dimensionality of data while retaining the most important features. It helps in visualizing and analyzing high-dimensional data.
Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning involves training an agent to make decisions by rewarding or penalizing it based on its actions. It is inspired by behavioral psychology and is used in scenarios where an agent must learn to make a sequence of decisions, such as playing a game or navigating a robot through an environment.

In reinforcement learning, the agent interacts with the environment and receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Over time, the agent learns the best strategies to maximize its rewards.

Key Techniques and Concepts
Training and Testing Data
To build a machine learning model, you need to divide your data into two parts: training data and testing data. The model learns from the training data and is evaluated on the testing data. This separation helps ensure that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.

Overfitting and Underfitting
Two common problems in machine learning are overfitting and underfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns too much from the training data, capturing noise rather than the actual patterns. This results in poor performance on new data. Underfitting happens when the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns, leading to poor performance on both training and testing data.

To address these issues, techniques such as cross-validation and regularization are used. Cross-validation involves splitting the data into multiple parts and training the model on different subsets to ensure it performs well across various data splits. Regularization adds constraints to the model to prevent it from becoming too complex.

Model Evaluation
Evaluating the performance of a machine learning model is crucial to understanding its effectiveness. Common metrics include:

Accuracy: The proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances.
Precision and Recall: Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions, while recall measures how well the model identifies all relevant instances.
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both.
Conclusion
Machine learning is a powerful tool that enables computers to learn from data and make informed decisions. By understanding the basics of supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as key concepts like training and testing data, overfitting, and model evaluation, you can better appreciate the capabilities and limitations of machine learning models. As the field continues to evolve, mastering these fundamentals will help you apply machine learning techniques effectively in various applications.
